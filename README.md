dlrg_converter
==============

A ruby script to handle conversion of event file from the DLRG result program to ARES/Sportlicht 

There are tow different incarnations of the program: 
* one to handle the CSV format used for individual competitions
* one to handle the CSV format used for team competitions

Currently the file names are hardcoded, and code is somewhat rough.
